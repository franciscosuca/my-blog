# Portfolio Starter

This is my starter portfolio that I worked on based on the template from [Vercel](https://portfolio-blog-starter.vercel.app).

## Demo

Demonstration of the original website cloned from Vercel, with the blogs pages.

## How to Use

Clone this repository and then run:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Afterwards
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Test build before triggering Github actions

````

**Not using pnpm?** Check [pnpm's website](https://pnpm.io/installation) to know how to install it.

## How to generate data for the projects/volunteering/workExperience page(s)

### Create a file 

On the path '/app/<folder>/posts', create a file with any name but in format '.mdx'

### Populate the file

On the file created on the previous step, fill the file with the following format:

```
